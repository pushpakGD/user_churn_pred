# Capstone Project - Google Advanced Data Analytics
## User Churn Prediction

The Google Advanced Data Analytics Capstone Project revolves around Employee Churn Prediction, a pivotal aspect of workforce management. This project applies advanced analytics techniques to scrutinize employee behavior trends and forecast potential departures. Through the application of concepts learned in data cleaning, visualization, statistical analysis, and machine learning, the objective is to construct a resilient model that equips organizations with the foresight to retain their valuable talent pool.

#### Business Scenario and Problem:
At Salifort Motors, the HR department is eager to enhance employee satisfaction levels. They've gathered data from their workforce, but are seeking guidance on how to effectively leverage it. As a data analytics professional, I've been consulted to offer data-driven insights and recommendations based on my analysis of the provided data.

#### Procedure followed:
- Plan: Initial EDA, checking for missing values, evaluating response and explanatory variables
- Analyze: Continue EDA, checking for outliers, analyzing relationships between variables
- Construct: Determine which models are appropriate, setting and confirming model assumptions, constructing ML model
- Execute: Recall evaluation metrics, interpret model performance and results, share key findings
  
#### Key Findings Extracted




#### Conclusions

Logistic Regression

- The logistic regression model achieved precision of 80%, recall of 83%, f1-score of 80% (all weighted averages), and accuracy of 83%, on the test set.
  
Tree-based Machine Learning

- After conducting feature engineering, the decision tree model achieved AUC of 93.8%, precision of 87.0%, recall of 90.4%, f1-score of 88.7%, and accuracy of 96.2%, on the test set. The random forest modestly outperformed the decision tree model.

##### Recommendation

The models and the feature importances extracted from the models confirm that employees at the company are overworked.
- Implement a limit on the number of projects assigned to each employee to prevent overwork and burnout.
- Consider promotions for employees who have dedicated at least four years to the company, or investigate reasons behind their dissatisfaction.
- Provide incentives for employees working extended hours, or consider flexible work arrangements to maintain a healthy work-life balance.
- Ensure all employees are well-informed about the company's overtime pay policies, and establish clear guidelines for workload expectations and time off.
- Facilitate open discussions at both company-wide and team levels to better understand and enhance the overall work culture.
- Evaluate employees based on proportional effort rather than solely on hours worked, to recognize and reward contributions effectively.
